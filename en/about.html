						<br>
						<p>New Taipei City maintains a fresh perspective, embracing renewal, connection, and innovation.
							<br><br>
							New Taipei City is an inclusive city with diverse cultures and a rich natural environment. Various ethnic groups migrate, settle, and take root here, gradually forming industrial clusters and cultural landscapes in different districts. Generation after generation, the people of New Taipei City seize the shared, vibrant passion of the present. They move from confrontation to inclusivity, from collaboration to recognition, embracing the enlightened power of experience. They constantly stimulate innovation through differences, seeking to experience the precious and elusive essence of harmony. Together, they envision a better future.
							<br><br>
							"New Art Land" exemplifies continuous construction along the Sanxia-Yingge Old Street. It witnesses the new evolution of the city, starting from the old town of Yingge, entering the Ceramic Museum representing industrial aesthetics, and welcoming the participation of everyone in the contemporary art museum. It embodies the fusion of the old and the new, where we feel the evolving vitality of life. Recognizing the value of diversity step by step, New Art Land becomes an attitude. We live in a realm full of possibilities and believe in the coexistence and future of people coming together.
							<br><br>
							During festivals, we call upon creators living in New Taipei City to engage in interdisciplinary creations. The theme of landscape installations involves a dialogue encompassing "change, collaboration, and belief," showcasing a compatibility that extends beyond mere abrupt innovation. It expresses differences and merges them into unity, a profound and personal experience of external conflicts and resolutions. It is a shared interpretation and coexistence in real-time, where performance becomes a ritual of celebration, commemoration, declaration, and defense, symbolizing renewal. As the opening drums resound, the power of people reverberates through the land. Collaboration gathers everyone together, and the notes dance between heaven and earth, embodying the ongoing momentum and hope, resonating with the energy of all. Together, we shout for the New Art Land.
							<br><br>
							The 2023 New Taipei City Arts Festival brings together people in the New Art Land to witness the interdisciplinary consensus that arises. Embracing the old while welcoming the new, celebrating the present, and observing the changes that are taking place.</div>

						<p>The 2023 New Taipei City Arts Festival, titled “New Art Land,” focuses on themes of
							transformation, transition, belief, ethnicity, and life. It aims to explore the extraction
							and refinement of land, transforming these ideas through mediums of expression and symbol
							exploration. The festival creates an environment for limitless imagination and
							interpretation, fostering a space for communication and collaboration to proclaim a new
							declaration of renewal in the New Art Land.</p> <br>
						<p>The festival kicks off with a grand opening performance by the Ju Percussion Group, combining
							traditional and contemporary elements. The interdisciplinary performance of percussion,
							dance, new media, and fireworks injects new energy and hope into the park. Visual art
							installations showcase the various facets of the New Art Land, featuring works by both
							domestic and international artists such as Alex Schweder + Ward Shelley, Chiu, Chen-Hung,
							UxU Studio, and Yuyu Art Studio. These artists explore the theme of transformation,
							portraying the connection between humans and the environment, migration, transmission, and
							aggregation, while intersecting with the changing urban landscape. Artists Liu, Chih–Hung,
							Ding, Chien-Chung, Yu, Wen-Fu, Li, Cheng–Liang, and ArchiBlur Lab present collaborative
							works that focus on the theme of conversion, illustrating the continuous interweaving and
							rotation of land and industry through various media. Artists Cyril Lancelin, Peng, Chien-Yu,
							Buteo Huang, Lin, Chien-Chih, and Chiang, Chung-Lun center their works on the theme of
							belief, employing symbol transformation to evoke the imaginative potential of individuals
							and create a collective experience in the newly formed terrain.</p><br>
						<p>During the weekends of the festival, performing arts productions invite the audience to
							become part of the festival’s new energy through music, movement, and dynamism. Local and
							diverse art teams from New Taipei City, including aoi, Wu Lou Chuang Yi Limited Liability
							Company, 汝妮Dungi Sapor, and Paliulius (8664), deliver immersive music performances that
							showcase the power of diversity in New Taipei. Teams such as Slackline Formosa, New Taipei
							Street Dance Tide, Str.ACD - Street Act Lab, Eye Catching Circus, and Fun Action gather
							people through extreme sports, street dance, parkour, and circus performances, creating a
							festive atmosphere. Theater groups like Puppet & Its Double Theater, Actorship, and Les
							Petites Choses Production lead the audience in participatory performances, allowing them to
							experience the vibrant energy of the New Art Land. Various themed tours, workshops, and
							specialty markets also come together in the festival, providing a convergence of energy,
							embracing the old and new alike, and inviting everyone to participate in this ongoing
							celebration of renewal.</p><br>
